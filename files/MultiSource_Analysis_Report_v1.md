- Over the six-month period, the net loss rose by \$64.8 million (+16.7%) year-over-year. <a href="/citations/a93d6758-4104-496c-94a7-3ea58151b1ae" data-tag="{&quot;tag&quot;: &quot;wand-citations&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;a93d6758-4104-496c-94a7-3ea58151b1ae&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;FILE&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Snowflake10q.pdf&quot;, &quot;snippet&quot;: &quot;Snowflake Inc.s quarterly report for the period ended July 31, 2023, details key financial metrics, including a revenue of $674 million, reflecting a 36% increase compared to the same quarter last year.

The primary drivers of the increased net loss were higher operating expenses, particularly in sales and marketing as well as research and development. These investments reflect Snowflake's ongoing efforts to expand its market presence and enhance its product offerings. <a href="/citations/a93d6758-4104-496c-94a7-3ea58151b1ae" data-tag="{&quot;tag&quot;: &quot;wand-citations&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;a93d6758-4104-496c-94a7-3ea58151b1ae&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;FILE&quot;, &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Snowflake10q.pdf&quot;, &quot;snippet&quot;: &quot;Snowflake Inc.s quarterly report for the period ended July 31, 2023, details key financial metrics, including a revenue of $674 million, reflecting a 36% increase compared to the same quarter last year.
